# tiad2016-workshop-IoTStreaming

A simple demo that displays the state of IoT devices on a basic interface updating in real-time. This package will be used during the IoT Streaming Workshop @ TIAD 2016.

Follow these steps to make it work:

1- Create a free account on streamdata.io to get your App Token at https://portal.streamdata.io/#/register.

2- Edit tiad.html and replace [YOUR_STREAMDATAIO_APP_TOKEN] with your Streamdata.io App Token.

4- Save and launch tiad.html in your favorite browser (works with Chrome, Firefox and Safari).

You are done! This is a support to be used during the workshop, as the Datashare API URLs provided are only temporary.
This can also be used as a base to stream your favorite API.
